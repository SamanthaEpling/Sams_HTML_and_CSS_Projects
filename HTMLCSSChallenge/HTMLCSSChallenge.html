                        On November 6, 2019 the Epling family said goodbye to a beloved member of the family, Mike-Winston.
                        He was estimated to be about 20 years of age, and due to either back or pastern problems, 
                        deemed unrideable.  This did not stop him from walking on many adventures, the few
                        short years he was with the Epling family.  He loved to see new places, eat new grasses.
                        He was an excellent companion to Romani and beloved by all who met him and a list of surviving 
                        relatives is below. <br>

                    <h2>Mike-Winston</h2>
                    <p>Mike-Winston arrived to the Epling family some 4 or 5 years ago, when a
                        previous horse had passed away and a companion was needed for the current
                        horse, Windy.  Mike-Winston was about the same size and coloring of
                        the horse that passed away, and he was in need of some tender loving care, 
                        he had been abandoned at the barn, several hundred pounds underweight and 
                        hooves severely neglected. It was determined that an unknown injury meant
                        that riding was not possible, but Mike-Winston could still hike!
                        So hike we did!  All over the hills of Gaston, Oregon.  His pain being too 
                        much to even hike comfortable, we made the humane decision to put him down

                    <h2>Romani</h2>
                    <p>Romani, an Arabian gelding, arrived to the Epling family February of 2017. 
                        His previous owners were seeking to get out of equine ownership and wanted
                        him to go to a family that would appreciate him.  He was deemed lively and 
                        requires some more training into the human-equine relationship prior to 
                        regular riding of any sort.  He enjoys the company of other horses very much, 
                        and since the passing of Mike-Winston, is enjoying the company of his pasture
                        neighbor, Fynn. <br>
