		<p>Here's what Wikipedia says about the legends of the Pekingese breed:</p>
		
		<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pekingese">
		There are two origin stories for the Pekingese.  The first is the most common, The Lion and the Marmoset:
			A lion and a marmoset fell in love.  But the lion was too large.  The lion went to the Buddha and tol him of his woes.  The Buddha allowed the lion to shrink down to the size of the marmoset.  And the Pekingese was the result.
		
		The Second, less-common, originating story is The Butterfly Lions:
			A lion fell in love with a butterfly.  But the butterfly and the lion knew the difference in size was too much to overcome.  Together they went to see the Buddha, who allowed their size to meet in the middle. From this, the Pekingese came.
